# Frontend Task

Using Vue.js and Tailwind, create a frontend web application that consumes the
RESTful API and allows users to perform the following actions:
- [x] Register and authenticate (login/logout).
- [x] Create, update, and delete blog posts.
- [ ] Read and filter blog posts by status, author, and date.
- [x] Create, update, and delete comments on blog posts.
- [x] Like and dislike blog posts
- [ ] Like and dislike blog comment

Notes : 
- The frontend should be responsive and user-friendly, with appropriate form
validations and error handling. Also, include appropriate authentication and
authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated users can perform
certain actions (e.g., create, update, or delete blog posts).
